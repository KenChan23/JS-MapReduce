# Sorting Algorithms

This simple npm module provides five rudimentary sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Future Plans

The primary goal is to implement support for as many sorting algorithms as possible. Hence the following is a list of algorithms to be later added in:

- Radix Sort
- Heap Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Counting Sort
- Shell Sort

## Testing

Tested using the Mocha TDD/BDD framework and the Chai assertion library.<br/><br/>Watch out for the Nyan Cat as all the tests pass with flying colors!

`npm test`
