/*
  The observer pattern is used in larger code bases consisting of a number of individual code modules that depend on,
or must communicate between, each other. In such a code base, hardcoded references from one module to other
modules provides what is known as tight coupling, the need to know explicitly about every other module in the system
for the whole code to function correctly together. Ideally, however, modules in a large code base should be loosely
coupled. References arenâ€™t made explicitly to other modules; rather, systemwide events are triggered and listened for
throughout the code base, like a custom version of the standard DOM event handling.
*/

/*
The system implementing the observer pattern must have three global methods avilable to the system code base:
publish(), which triggers an event by name, passing along any optional data; subscribe(), which allows a module
to assign a function to execute when a specific, named event is triggered; and unsubscribe(), which deassigns the
function so that it will no longer be executed when the named event is triggered. The code in Listing 7-6 demonstrates
a simple object that can be used globally in your applications to implement these methods in the observer pattern.
