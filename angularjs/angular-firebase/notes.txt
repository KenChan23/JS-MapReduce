AngularJS - MV* Framework
          - provide HTML with more functionality
          - excellent documentation
          - well-written books
          - large community
          - superb integration with frameworks such as Ionic

Features
--------
  - ViewModel represents the model for the view and is bound to various UI elements.
  - As the ViewModel changes, the UI elements update themselves. If a value is changed within any of the UI elements, the corresponding ViewModel gets updated. (two-way data binding)
  - The model gets updated whenever the DOM is updated, and vice-versa applies.
  - Use JavaScript objects for data binding.
  - Simplify AJAX communication $http service.
  - Provide a higher level abstraction than $http service with $resource service. Communicate with RESTful APIs.
  - HTTP interceptors handle global errors, authentication or asynchronous/synchronous processing of request, etc.
  - Directives teach HTML new tricks. Build custom HTML elements, attributes, etc.
  - Dependency Injection
  - AngularJS has excellent support for unit testing.

Two Complexities of MVC Frameworks
----------------------------------
  - View becomes complex: utilize a template engine such as Handlebars to dynamically generate front-end
  - Controller becomes complex: keep controllers simple by delegating only data transfer methods to the controller, and leaving the client to display the data

ngApp directive - Autobootstrap AngularJS application
                - Part of ng core module
                - ng module is loaded by default when an AngularJS application is started
                - Designates root element of the application
                - Whenever AngularJS finds the ngApp directive, it loads the module associated with the directive.

Directives: Markers on DOM element (such as attributes, element name, etc.)
            - Directives tell AngularJS's HTML compiler to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element or even transform the DOM element and its children.

Bootstrapping: AngularJS's initialization process.
        Done in Two Ways
            - Automatic Initialization (encounters ngApp directive)
            - Manual Initialization (perform an operation before compilation of page by AngularJS)

{{  }} - renders the value inside of the corresponding variable inside the DOM element. Expression holder

Two Way Data Binding - UI control reflects the value of the underlying model and vice versa.

ng-repeat directive instatiates a template once per item in the follection provided.
Each template instance gets its own scope, and $index is set to the item index or key.

Create a new module:

  angular.module(name, [requires], [configFn])
